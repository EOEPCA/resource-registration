# Architecture

Subcomponent architecture and interfaces.
Resource Registration supports the ingestion of data and its associated metadata into the platform services â€“ including, but not limited to:

- Metadata registration into Resource Discovery service
- Data registration into Data Access services for data retrieval and visualisation

The Resource Registration building-block is a companion to Resource Discovery in terms of satisfying the ingestion of the resource types supported by Resource Discovery. Thus, it provides a RESTful service interface for registration of all the Resource Types supported by the Resource Discovery Building Block.

![Resource Registration architecture](https://eoepca.readthedocs.io/projects/architecture/en/latest/reference-architecture/diagrams/resource-registration.drawio.png)

As described in the [System Architecture document](https://eoepca.readthedocs.io/projects/architecture/) the Resource Registration Building Block includes the following components:

* **Registration API**<br>
  For record Create, Update and Delete operations. The API is based on OGC standards for the registration of records into the platform. For the simple cases that a resource is already in the appropriate format (STAC, Record, ISO 19115, Dublin Core) the OGC API Features Part 4 (Create, Replace, Update and Delete - Transactions) is used to register those resources. In cases where transformation/validation needs to take place, an OGC API - Processes interface is defined for registering the appropriate resources.

* **Harvester**
  To ingest records from other (external) data sources. The Harvester proactively initiates and orchestrates the harvesting capability, and uses Harvester Data Source implementation to handle specific data sources.

* **Harvester Data Source(s)**
  Provides an integration with a specific data source to provide customised support for record harvesting and interpretation. Designed to be plugged-in to the Harvester for a given deployment. Harvesting is supported from the following sources for metadata: OGC API Records, STAC (static), Opensearch. for registration of data assets the following sources are supported: S3 object storage, HTTP, Filesystem, Swift object storage.


## Harvester Data Sources / Workflows

As described in the overall building block architecture, the concept of the Harvester Data Source is represented by a Harvester workflow implementation. The inital set of Harvester Data Sources / Workflows is provided here. With DLR terrabyte as an operational platform for the Registration building block, this selection is primarily driven by the data requirements of the terrabyte users.

### Other

The Resource Registration BB is extensible for other datasets and providers, that need to be integrated for harvesting. In general, Harvester Data Sources / Workflows will support the following metadata sources for harvesting:
- OGC API Records
- STAC
- OpenSearch
- OData?

Downloading will be supported from the following sources:
- S3 object storage
- HTTP
- Filesystem
- Swift object storage
